There are three different tasks, each demonstrating simple decision-making in C++ using `if-else` statements:

Program 1: Tax Calculator
1. The program asks the user to input their salary in USD.
2. Based on the salary range, the program calculates the tax using the following rules:
   - No tax if the salary is $2000 or less.
   - 20% tax if the salary is between $2001 and $3000.
   - 30% tax if the salary is between $3001 and $5000.
   - 40% tax if the salary is above $5000.
3. After calculating the tax, the program determines the income after tax by subtracting the tax from the salary.
4. Finally, it displays the calculated tax and the income after tax.

Program 2: Number Type Checker
1. The program asks the user to input a number.
2. It checks if the number is zero, even, or odd:
   - If the number is 0, it outputs "The number is zero."
   - If the number is divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`), it is even.
   - Otherwise, the number is odd.
3. It then prints the result based on the check.

Program 3: Steel Grade Determiner
1. The program asks the user to input three properties of steel:
   - Hardness
   - Carbon content
   - Tensile strength
2. Based on specific conditions, the program assigns a grade to the steel:
   - Grade 10: All three conditions are met.
   - Grade 9: Hardness > 50 and Carbon content < 0.7.
   - Grade 8: Carbon content < 0.7 and Tensile strength > 5600.
   - Grade 7: Hardness > 50 and Tensile strength > 5600.
   - Grade 6: Any one condition is satisfied.
   - Grade 5: None of the conditions are satisfied.
3. The program displays the calculated grade.

Common Concepts Used:
- `if-else` statements for decision-making.
- Logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR) to combine conditions.
- Modulus operator (`%`) to check divisibility.
- Basic input/output operations using `cin` and `cout`.

These programs are great when it comes to using conditional logic to solve real-world problems like tax calculation, number properties, and material classification.
