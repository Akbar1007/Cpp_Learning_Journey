This program processes student scores.
It has two main parts:

First, the writeStudentData() function asks the user to enter information for 3 students.
For each student, it takes the ID, name, and three exam scores.
It writes the ID, name, and scores to a file called students.txt.
It also calculates the average of the three scores and writes the student's name and average to another file called averages.txt.
If the files cannot be opened, it shows an error message.

Second, the readAndDisplayData() function opens both students.txt and averages.txt.
It reads the contents of both files and prints them to the console.
Again, if the files cannot be opened, it shows an error message.

In main(), the program prints a title message, calls writeStudentData(), and then calls readAndDisplayData().

The program uses basic file input/output, strings, loops, and simple formatting for output.
