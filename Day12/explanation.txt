Day 12:
Four pillars of OOP:

Classes:
class className {};

className = the name of the class
Inside {} is the class body - class members and methods.

Class members: declaration of variables and functions within the class.
They are either private or public. 
The keywords private and public are knows as visibility labels.
These keywords are followed by a colon ':'

An example: 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box
{
public:
    double length;   // Length of a box
    double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
    double height;   // Height of a box
};

int main()
{
    Box Box1;  // Declare Box1 of type Box
    Box Box2;  // Declare Box2 of type Box
    double volume = 0.0;  // Store the volume of a box here

    // Box 1 specification
    Box1.height = 5.0;
    Box1.length = 6.0;
    Box1.breadth = 7.0;

    // Box 2 specification
    Box2.height = 10.0;
    Box2.length = 12.0;
    Box2.breadth = 13.0;

    // Volume of Box 1
    volume = Box1.height * Box1.length * Box1.breadth;
    cout << "Volume of Box1 : " << volume << endl;

    // Volume of Box 2
    volume = Box2.height * Box2.length * Box2.breadth;
    cout << "Volume of Box2 : " << volume << endl;

    return 0;
}

This program defines a Box class with length, breadth, and height attributes, then calculates and displays the volume for two different boxes. Let me know if you need modifications!


The class members that have been declared as private can be accessed only from within the class. This is called data hiding = a key feature of OOP
Public ones can be accessed outside too.

By default the members of class are private. Thus, using the keyword private is optional.

set funtions are sometimes called mutators and get funtions are sometimes called accessors.
