Description:

This program demonstrates the concept of inheritance in C++ through a student result system. It uses three classes:

1. Student – The base class that stores basic student info: ID, name, university, and group number.
2. Test – Inherits from Student and adds test scores in three subjects: Physics, OOP, and English.
3. Result – Inherits from Test and calculates the total score and GPI (Grade Point Index, or average).

In the main() function, a Result object is created with sample data. The program then displays the full result, including personal info, subject scores, total marks, and the average score.

This example helps you understand how inheritance allows one class to reuse and build upon another.
