Description of the code in Day 13:

The given C++ program defines a Book class that represents books with attributes such as bookID, title, author, and price. It implements constructors, a destructor, and a method to display book details. Below is a breakdown of the code:

1. Book.h (Header File)
This file defines the Book class and declares its attributes and methods.

Class Attributes:
- bookID → Stores the book's unique identifier.
- title → Stores the title of the book.
- author → Stores the author's name.
- price → Stores the price of the book.

Constructors:
- Default Constructor (Book())  
  - Initializes book details with default values:  
    - bookID = 0
    - title = "Unknown"
    - author = "Unknown"
    - price = 0.0

- Parameterized Constructor (Book(int id, string tit, string auth, float p))  
  - Initializes a book object with given values.

Destructor (~Book())  
- Prints "The book is deleted!" when an object is destroyed.

Method:
- display() → Prints book details (ID, title, author, and price).

2. main.cpp (Main Program)
This file includes Book.h and implements the constructor and display() method outside the class definition.

Implementation of Constructor
- The parameterized constructor initializes the book attributes.

Implementation of display()
- Prints book details to the console.

Inside main()
1. Creates three Book objects:
   - object → Uses the default constructor.
   - object2(1, "IELTS 19", "Cambridge", 3) → Uses the parameterized constructor.
   - object3(2, "Writing 2024 review", "Teacher", 1) → Uses the parameterized constructor.

2. Calls display() for each object to print book details.

Expected Output:
Book ID: 0
Book title: Unknown
Book author: Unknown
Price: 0

Book ID: 1
Book title: IELTS 19
Book author: Cambridge
Price: 3

Book ID: 2
Book title: Writing 2024 review
Book author: Teacher
Price: 1

The book is deleted!
The book is deleted!
The book is deleted!

(The destructor message appears three times, once for each object.)
