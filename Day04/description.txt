There are three programs about key programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.


Program 1: Product of Odd Integers (1 to 15)

- Objective: Calculate the product of all odd integers between 1 and 15.
- Key Concepts:
  - Use of a `while` loop to iterate through numbers.
  - Conditional statement (`if`) to check if a number is odd.
  - Multiplication of numbers within the loop to find the product.
- Expected Output: 
  Displays the result of multiplying all odd numbers from 1 to 15.

Program 2: Sum of Numbers Between Two Inputs

- Objective: Compute the sum of integers between two numbers (`m` and `n`) provided by the user.
- Key Concepts:
  - Taking user input using `cin`.
  - Using a `for` loop to iterate from `m` to `n`.
  - Accumulating the sum of all integers in the specified range.
- Expected Output:
  Displays the sum of all numbers from `m` to `n`, inclusive.

Program 3: Simple Calculator

- Objective: Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.
- Key Concepts:
  - Taking user input for an operator and two numbers.
  - Using a `switch` statement to handle different operations.
  - Handling division by zero to avoid runtime errors.
  - Providing feedback for invalid operations.
- Expected Output:
  - Correctly calculates and displays the result for valid operations.
  - Displays an error message for invalid operators or division by zero.

Learning Goals
1. Understand how to use loops (`while`, `for`) to iterate through a range of values.
2. Practice using conditional statements to perform specific actions based on conditions.
3. Learn how to handle user input and output using `cin` and `cout`.
4. Explore the `switch` statement for making decisions based on multiple cases.
5. Implement basic error handling (e.g., division by zero).

Additional Tasks you may work on:
- Pay attention to edge cases like invalid inputs or division by zero.
- Experiment with the programs by providing different inputs to understand their behavior.
- Observe how variables are updated and used in different scenarios.
