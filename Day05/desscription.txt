There are four programs in this day and each performs a different task.

1. Finding the Largest Number
   - The program asks the user to input 10 numbers, one at a time.
   - It keeps track of the largest number entered so far using a variable called `largest`.
   - For each number entered, it checks if it's the largest so far. If yes, it updates the value of `largest`.
   - After all 10 numbers are entered, it displays the largest number.

2. Generating a Multiplication Table
   - The program generates and displays a table where:
     - The first column is the numbers from 1 to 5.
     - The second column is each number multiplied by 10.
     - The third column is each number multiplied by 100.
     - The fourth column is each number multiplied by 1000.
   - The `\t` is used to add spacing between columns, making the table aligned.

3. Printing a Right-Angled Triangle of Stars
   - The program prints a pattern of stars in the shape of a right-angled triangle.
   - The triangle has 5 rows, and each row contains an increasing number of stars (1 star in the first row, 2 in the second, and so on).
   - This is achieved using nested loops:
     - The outer loop runs for each row.
     - The inner loop prints the stars for that row.

4. Printing a Pyramid of Numbers
   - The program prints a pyramid of numbers.
   - The pyramid has 5 rows, with each row containing increasing numbers starting from 1 (e.g., row 1 has "1", row 2 has "12", etc.).
   - To make it look like a pyramid:
     - Spaces are printed before the numbers in each row to align them correctly.
   - Nested loops are used:
     - One loop prints spaces before the numbers.
     - Another loop prints the numbers for that row.

At the end of the program, the `return 0;` statement signals that the program has executed successfully. This is something I forgot to tell in the previous days!!!


Learning Goals:
1. Understand loops inside loops.
2. Practice using conditional statements.
3. Slightly difficult programs to practice.
