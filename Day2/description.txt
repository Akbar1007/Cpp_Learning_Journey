This program contains three small exercises for learning C++ concepts. 


Program 1: Working with Numbers
- Purpose: Input three integers from the user, then calculate and display:
  - Their sum, average, and product.
  - The smallest and largest number among them.


Program 2: Generating a Table
- Purpose: Display a table of integers (0 to 10), showing their:
  - Square (number × number)
  - Cube (number × number × number)
- This is achieved using a simple **power function**.


Program 3: Calculating Daily Driving Costs
- Purpose: Calculate the daily cost of driving based on:
  - Total kilometers driven.
  - Gasoline cost per liter.
  - Average kilometers per liter of fuel efficiency.
- Outputs the total cost in a clear format.


These programs introduce basic concepts such as:
- Input and output (`cin`, `cout`).
- Arithmetic calculations.
- Logical comparisons and conditions.
- Using functions like `pow()` for calculations.
