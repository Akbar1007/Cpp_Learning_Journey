There are three programs in Day 11:  

Today, we continue exploring important programming concepts such as pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and 2D array manipulation. These topics are important for optimizing performance and efficiently managing memory. 

Program 1 - Finding the Largest Element Using Pointers 
This program finds the largest element in an array using pointers. The findLargest function iterates through the array using pointer arithmetic and keeps track of the maximum value. Memory for the array is dynamically allocated using new and later freed using delete[] to prevent memory leaks.  

Program 2 - Calculating the Average Using Pointers  
This program calculates the average of an array of integers by summing the elements using pointer arithmetic and dividing by the total number of elements. The array is dynamically allocated, and the calculateAverage function shows efficient memory handling with pointers.  

Program 3 - Modifying and Printing a 2D Array Using Pointers 
The program works with a 3x3 2D array using pointer notation. It includes two functions:
- modify2DArray updates a specific element in the array using pointer arithmetic.
- print2DArray displays the contents of the array by accessing elements through pointers.  
By modifying an element in the array and printing the updated matrix, this program shows how pointers can be used to manipulate multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.
