Description of the code in Day 14:

The given C++ program has a simple ATM system using three classes: Account, Balance, and ATM. It demonstrates object-oriented programming OOP concepts such as encapsulation, constructors, and class interactions. 

The breakdown of the code:

1. Account.h Header File  
This file defines the Account class, which stores user details.

Class Attributes:  
- AccountName → Stores the name of the account holder.  
- PinNumber → Stores the user's PIN hidden for security reasons.  

Constructor:  
- Parameterized Constructor Account string name, int pin  
- Initializes the account with the provided name and PIN.  

Method:  
- Display → Prints account details, including the account holder's name and a hidden PIN for security.  


2. Balance.h Header File  
This file defines the Balance class, which tracks the user's recent transactions.

Class Attributes:  
- Withdrawal → Stores the last withdrawal amount.  
- Deposit → Stores the last deposit amount.  
- BalanceInquiry → Stores the current account balance.  

Constructor:  
- Parameterized Constructor Balance int withdrawal, int deposit, int balance  
- Initializes transaction details and the current balance.  

Method:  
- Show → Displays the last withdrawal, last deposit, and current balance.  


3. ATM.h Header File  
This file defines the ATM class, which acts as a central interface for user account and balance details.

Class Attributes:  
- Account account → Represents the user's account.  
- Balance balance → Represents the user's transaction details.  

Constructor:  
- Parameterized Constructor ATM string name, int pin, int withdrawal, int deposit, int balanceAmount  
- Initializes the Account and Balance objects using provided values.  

Method:  
- ShowATMDetails → Displays the user's account details name and hidden PIN and balance information.  


4. main.cpp - Main Program  
This file includes ATM.h and serves as the entry point of the program.

Implementation in main:  
1. Creates an ATM object with sample data Akbar, 1234, 100, 500, 2000.  
2. Calls ShowATMDetails to display account and balance information.  


Expected Output:  
ATM User Information:  
Account Name: Akbar  
PIN: **** hidden for security  

Balance Information:  
Last Withdrawal: $100  
Last Deposit: $500  
Current Balance: $2000  


This day's program demonstrates class composition using Account and Balance within ATM, encapsulation hiding user PIN, and OOP principles in C++. It can be expanded further by adding functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, and PIN authentication.
