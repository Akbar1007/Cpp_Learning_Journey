Today's program shows class templates and runtime polymorphism in C++ using a student management app.

It defines a base class and a templated derived class:

Person is the base class containing shared attributes such as name, age, and gender and includes a virtual Display() function to allow polymorphic behavior.

Student is a class template derived from Person, which introduces a templated ID field to support different data types for student identification. The Display() function is overridden to include the ID along with inherited attributes.

Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Runtime Polymorphism is shown through the virtual Display() function and dynamic binding via the Person base class.
Templates are used to create generic Student objects with different ID data types, such as int, string, long, and char.
Constructor Inheritance is utilized as the derived class constructor calls the base class constructor to initialize shared attributes.
Encapsulation is maintained with attributes being protected and accessed or printed only through public methods.
Memory Management is handled implicitly as the objects are stack-allocated and the virtual destructor in the base class ensures proper cleanup if needed in a polymorphic context.

This example provides a practical application of class templates and polymorphism in C++ object-oriented programming.
